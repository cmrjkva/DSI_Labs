    "Suppose you're working for Mayo Clinic, widely recognized to be the top hospital in the United States. In your work, you've overheard nurses and doctors discuss test results, then arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not someone has developed a particular disease or condition. For example, you might overhear something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Nurse**: Male 57 year-old patient presents with severe chest pain. FDP _(short for fibrin degradation product)_ was elevated at 13. We did an echo _(echocardiogram)_ and it was inconclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Doctor**: What was his interarm BP? _(blood pressure)_\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Nurse**: Systolic was 140 on the right; 110 on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Doctor**: Dammit, it's an aortic dissection! Get to the OR _(operating room)_ now!\n",
    "\n",
    "> _(intense music playing)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this fictitious but [Shonda Rhimes-esque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shonda_Rhimes#Grey's_Anatomy,_Private_Practice,_Scandal_and_other_projects_with_ABC) scenario, you might imagine the doctor going through a series of steps like a [flowchart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart), or a series of if-this-then-that steps to diagnose a patient. The first steps made the doctor ask what the interarm blood pressure was. Because interarm blood pressure took on the values it took on, the doctor diagnosed the patient with an aortic dissection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal, as a research biostatistical data scientist at the nation's top hospital, is to develop a medical test that can improve upon our current diagnosis system for [chronic kidney disease (CKD)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world problem**: Develop a medical diagnosis test that is better than our current diagnosis system for CKD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data science problem**: Develop a medical diagnosis test that reduces both the number of false positives and the number of false negatives."
